This file uses the following analytic dataset to address several research
questions regarding physical activities people do.

Dataset Name: demo_paq_analytic_file created in external file
STAT6250-01_w17-team-4_project2_data_preparation.sas, which is assumed to be
in the same directory as this file.

See included file for dataset properties.

title1
"Question: How much time are the top 10 walking or biking lovers spend on walking or biking in 30 days?"
;

title2
"Rationale: This would help to estimate the time the true walking or biking lovers spend."
;

footnote1
"Based on the output,the top 10 walking or biking lovers spend 10800 to 16800 minutes in 30 days. That is at least six hours everyday, and the first one spends 10 hours everyday!"
;

footnote2
"Given the magnitude of these numbers, further investigation should be performed to ensure no data errors are involved."
;

footnote3
"However, assuming there are no data issues underlying this analysis, possible explanation for such large numbers include work needs and professional training."
;

*
Note: Total_Time_WalkBike, The total time spent on walking or biking in 30 days
is roughly estimated.

Methodology:  use proc print to display the first 10 rows of the dataset that
was sorted by Total_Time_WalkBike in descending order in the data-prep file.

title1
"Question: Who like walking or biking based on gender, age, and annual family income?"
;

title2
"Rationale:This would help to identify if gender, age, and annual family income play roles in determining people's physical activity choices."
;

footnote1
"Based on the outputs, gender and annual family income don't play roles in determining people's physical activity choices, but age really does. Men are slightly more likely to like walking or biking than women,32.34% male and 28.75 female like walking or biking.
All annual family income groups have almost same percentage,about 28%, of people like it. However, the older people are,the less likely they like walking or biking, 47.9% people younger than 21 like it, and 30.5% people who are between 21-30 years old like it,but only 16.88% people older than 70 do. "
;

footnote2
"These outputs show that whether men or women, whether the rich or the poor, all equally like walking or biking. However, walking or biking require time and energy, so age matters in choosing it."
;

*
Methodology: Use proc format to format gender and WalkBike_Status, and to group
age and annual_family_income to categorical variables first. Then use proc freq 
to create cross-table.

"Question: What is the average time they spend on walking or biking in 30 days by gender, age, and annual family income?"
;

title2
"Rationale: This would help to estimate the time different groups of people spend on walking and biking."
;

footnote1
"Based on the output, Men spend more time on walking or biking than women. The average time is 743 minutes for men and 611 minutes for women."
;

footnote2
"The possible explanation would be that walking or biking are energy consuming. Men are stronger than women in walking or biking."
;

and biking in 30 days by gender, age, and annual family income.
